# Weather Data Pipeline (Learn Python by Building a Real Project)

This repository is part of a hands-on tutorial series where we learn 
Python for data engineering by building a complete Weather Data Pipeline.
The project uses a Bronze → Silver → Gold architecture and includes:

- API ingestion  
- Data cleaning  
- Parquet output  
- SQL loading  
- Logging  
- Config files  
- Scheduling  
- Full pipeline orchestration

## Labs that are done: 

Lab 1: Project Setup + Folder Structure
Lab 2: Calling the Weather API + Error Handling
Lab 3: Data Cleaning + Transformations
Lab 4: Converting CSV to Parquet
Lab 5: Loading Data into a SQL Database
Lab 6: Logging (the thing engineers use daily)
Lab 7: Config Files (your future best friend)
Lab 8: Pipeline Runner (your first mini Airflow DAG)
Lab 9: Scheduling Your Pipeline
Lab 10: Building a Final Report / Dashboard
